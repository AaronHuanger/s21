Hi y'all, my name is Calvin, and I'm super excited for my first quarter as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for CS156! CS156 is such a valuable course for bridging the gap between college assignments and real-world development, and I think everyone who takes it develops teamwork skills that will be useful for the rest of their career. 

As for me, I'm a 3rd year CE major, and I have a broad range of interests and experiences in both CE and CS that I am always down to chat about, including AI/ML, embedded systems development, data science, web development, research, and IEEE at UCSB.
If anyone ever wants to talk about some other upper div engineering classes, I have take CS 138, CS 165, CS 195, ECE 153, ECE 157, and CS 176A. I am also in the Technology Management Program at UCSB, and I have taken TMP 120, TMP 124, TMP 127. I also hope to participate in the New Venture Competition next year!

In my free time, I try to always be reading at least one book, and I love talking about them with anyone who also shares my passion! I also enjoy a broad range of games, both on PC and Xbox.
Some of my all time favorites include Overwatch, Modern Warfare, Minecraft, Skyrim, Civilization 5, and FTL. I'm always interested in hearing about any cool games I haven't tried yet, and I have plenty of recommendations for people looking to try out a new one!

When I'm not stuck inside, I like to stay active as much as possible! This includes basketball or beach volleyball down here in sunny Isla Vista, or hiking/backpacking trips all across California.
If you ever wanna talk about some amazing trails, I am always down to share some(or hear about some I haven't visited).
