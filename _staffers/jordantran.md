Hello! My name is Jordan and I am a third year Statistics and Data Science major! I am a transfer student, so this is my first year at UCSB and haven't had the pleasure of being on campus yet. Therefore, I am doubly excited when we return to in-person classes so I can fully experience UCSB's culture and re-meet all those I've met online! Being on topic of new things, I am also very excited to be a ULA for the first time and to teach all of those brand new to programming and Data Science.

I've always been the student that asks Professors and TAs tons of questions and understand how difficult coding can be first starting out. Two years ago, I used to be a Psychology major but had to take a programming course for a pre-requisite. I remember the struggles and pain as a complete beginner in this course. However, when the quarter ended, I found myself enjoying programming and wanting to learn more. I really hope to share this passion I've grown and to get you all wanting to learn more as well!  Also, while being on the other side of things now, my goal is to make everything not so intimidating and to strive to be an approachable, useful learning resource to all of you!

In my free time, I enjoy hiking. I usually go hiking locally once a week on Sundays and enjoy the peacefulness compared to city life. I recently visited Zion National Park and must rate some of the hikes there in my top 5, particularly The Narrows. I also enjoy cars and recently purchased my first one. I've been really enjoying learning how to maintain it on my own and modifying it to my liking. It's always a big stress reliever taking a morning cruise in the mountains and enjoying the breeze with my windows down. I am also a big fan of anime and I always binge a random series when I'm too stressed to work. I'd love some recommendations for ongoing or old ones to binge next! I also have recently been having fun exploring random Kaggle datasets and improving my own Data Science skills. So in conjunction to the course, whether it’s about hiking, cars, anime, Data Science, or whatever else, feel free to come chat with me and let’s get through this quarter together!
