Hi, I'm Max. I'm a 4th year CS major and a first-time ULA for Professor Conrad's CS156. Outside of programming, I spend my time gaming, studying trivia, and working remotely on Activision Blizzard's Overwatch esports team.

My first exposure to programming was on my high school FRC team, where I didn't actually program anything and instead bashed pieces of metal together for the code to live in. I eventually started programming when at UCSB, and transferred in to the CS major in my 2nd year. As a ULA, I particularly want to help students who don't have a storied programming history, and since CS156 is one of the only courses where students are exposed to concepts like mutation testing, programming as a team, and working on legacy projects, it's really important that students leave the course with a good understanding of its material. For students aiming to enter industry, CS156 is probably the closest class to a pure software engineering course. I took it back when it was still CS56 and not as fleshed out as it is today, but its usefulness has only increased since then.

Feel free to stop by my office hours for questions about CS coursework, recommended electives, or any of the interests I listed above!
