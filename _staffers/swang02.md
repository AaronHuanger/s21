Hi! My name is Shiran and I am now a 4th-year undergrad student majoring in CS. I have experience with web development, iOS application, database systems and game design in UE4. Other than CS, I also enjoy watching Netflix and Kpop, sketching and painting. Feel free to come to my office hours to chat about anything!
