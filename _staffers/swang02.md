Hi! My name is Shiran and I am now a 4th-year undergrad student majoring in CS. I have experience with web development, iOS application, database systems and game design in UE4. When I was taking C148 which still was called cs48, me and my teammates was doing a iOS app called "tree" reminding users to drink water on time, and I was taking charge of the front-end construction. Besides that, I also have a lot of front-end experiences with the web development. For the game design part, I am kind of familiar of combining blueprints and coding together to build games in UE4. Hope all previous technical experience could help students for their projects. 

The reason I'd like to be an ULA is because I am having my last quarter at UCSB right now and I wish I could have more connections with other students at this pandemic time and more memories for the rest time at UCSB. Also, I still remembered how the LAs helped me when I was taking these CS courses, so I would like to apply what I saw and learned from them back to my teams now. Previously, I was doing tutoring at the elementary school to help kids build their dancing robots by contrucing the circuits and using the 3D printer. This kind of taught me how to be an active listener and the way to translate difficult knowledge into easily-understanding stuffs. Moreover, the combination between computer science and education is a thing I always want to take a try and might be a path that I am willing to go for in the future.

Other than CS, I also enjoy watching Netflix and Kpop, sketching and painting, and making short films. Feel free to come to my office hours to chat about anything!
