Hello! My name is Meng Vong and I'm a third-year statistics and data science student. A few things about myself. First, I am not a cat. Second, I am also a part of the Data 
Science Fellowship here at UCSB which I love being a part of and encourage anyone who is interested to apply! I learned so many things about data science and got to have hands-on
experience creating visualizations and analysis for big projects! Currently, my team and I are working to find any relationship between Sardine fish larvae and their catch. 

This is my first time being an ULA and I specifically wanted to help students in this course because I believe anyone could learn data science material regardless of their 
discipline of study. And ultimately, I want to be a part of the learning community that flourishes this. I didn't have any coding experience before attending college, so 
I am saying, from personal experience, that  this field is very welcoming and there are many supportive people here to help yalls succeed :) 

There has been many instances where I would be stuck on a problem
or would just like to know more about the concept of a material, and I would often turn to the ULA, TAs, or Professors during office hours. I want to mirror the welcoming and
helpful feeling I got and hope to also learn more as a ULA.

Aside from that, my mom says I'm a video game addict, and she's completely right. I play League of Legends, and I peaked Masters rank, but also played more casual games like 
Pokemon, Yugioh, and Ace Attorney. I also like party games, my favorite being codenames, jackbox games, and others.

Looking forward to talk about either academic work or some more casual topics :D
