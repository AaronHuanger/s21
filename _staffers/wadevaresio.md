Hello everyone, I'm Wade and I am a third year Computer Science Major. I am an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for CS 156 this quarter, this is also my first time being a ULA. A fun fact about me, I transferred to UCSB in the Fall of 2020, so I have actually never taken a UCSB class in person! I took CS 156 last quarter (Winter 2021) and loved it, I believe it is an extremely important class that teaches students skills that are absolutely important when working in the real world such as: working in a team, being able to read others code, using version control extensively, amongst many other important topics.

A big reason why I wanted to become a ULA is due to a combination of the amazing help/support I have received from ULA's in current/past quarters as well as my experience mentoring high school students at the Dos Pueblos Engineering Academy in my first two years in college. One thing I have learned over the years learning to program, is that programming is similar to learning a new language (a spoken language), where practice is the key to learning and improving. Whereas on the flip side, if one does not practice/utilize their newfound skills they tend to forget them. I hope to employ this ideology when working with students to reassure them that they are capable of succeeding, it just takes practice!

A little known fact about me, is that I am a Goleta native, so feel free to ask about the area! Outside of school, I enjoy utilizing the bike paths throughout Goleta as well as walking along the Ellwood Bluffs.

If I had to pick a favorite programming language, I would choose Java, due to wide range of uses and being platform independent.

I look forward to working with everyone, and feel free to reach out to me with any CS related questions!
