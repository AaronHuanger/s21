Hi everyone! I'm Doris and i'm a second year Computer Science major and my pronouns are She/Her/Hers. This is my first time being a Undergraduate Learning Assistant, so i'm very nervous yet eager to meet everyone in CS32 this Spring quarter. 

The most exciting thing I find about becoming an ULA is the ability to help others who are still being introduced to coding. I find it most rewarding when I'm able to understand certain coding concepts and could explain them to my peers who were still having trouble with it. Specifically, I've had several friends from high school who all took introductory Computer Science courses in college despite being in different majors. Knowing this, I wanted to help them even more since I felt responsible for introducing them to CS and helping them realize the beauty in coding. In addition, I know that by tutoring others in this course, i'll be able to reinforce my own foundations in computer science.

During my free times, you can catch me watching an excessive amount of Chinese and Korean dramas, idolizing my two Japanese Spitz dogs, or just chilling in bed all day. I'm also a huge night owl, so if you're stuck doing an assignment or project at 4 in the morning, feel free to message me. You can also visit me during my office hours if you have any questions or just want someone to talk to. I look forward to working with everyone this quarter!
