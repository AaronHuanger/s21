Hi everyone! I'm Doris and i'm a second year Computer Science major. This is my first time being a Undergraduate Learning Assistant and I look forward to helping everyone learn in CS32. 

During my free times, you can catch me watching an excessive amount of Chinese and Korean dramas, idolizing my two Japanese Spitz dogs, or just chilling in bed all day.

If you have any questions or just want someone to talk to feel free to visit me during my office hours or email/message me. I look forward to working with everyone this quarter!
