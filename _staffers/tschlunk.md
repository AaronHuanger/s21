Hey everyone! My name is Torin and I’m a first year Computer Engineering student! I took CS 8 as a student just two short quarters ago; I’m loving learning computer science so far and I look forward to experiencing the other side of things by also contributing to the teaching process!

Having never experienced UCSB on campus, discussing coding problems and troubleshooting in and out of class has been some of the most fun and rewarding social contact I’ve had with fellow UCSB students so far, and I hope to have similar experiences while participating in this program. My passion for computer science and technology in general comes from a love for problem-solving which I discovered partly by participating in high school robotics (FRC) as a strategist and team leader. I hope to kindle a similar sentiment in more students as a ULA and help them to develop useful skills and do work that they can take pride in, just like ULAs in my past classes did for me!

In 190J I am excited to meet a team of enthusiastic, outgoing, and kind people who chose to spend their time helping fellow students learn, and to grow my teaching and communication skills, which are useful for much more than just acting as a ULA, alongside them.

Outside of school, some of my favorite hobbies are playing video games, drooling over custom mechanical keyboards and lightweight mice, and taking photos!
