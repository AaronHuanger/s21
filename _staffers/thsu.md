Hi everyone! My name is Tiffany Hsu and I am a second year Environmental Studies major. 

I took my first coding class this past fall quarter with Prof. K and fell in love with learning how to use data as a proxy for solving real world problems. Looking back, I realize the power of guidance and help from the tutors and professors. I look forward to being able to apply my skills to help students navigate through this class in the same way that my mentors and peers helped me.

Because I am not a CS or data science major, I can relate to anyone who feels intimidated by the mere idea of coding or programming. Oftentimes, it is easy to compare yourself to other students who have more experience. Although I am an ES major, I actually find it easier to communicate tricky concepts in simpler terms to others who may not be familiar with the jargon. I have also found that the most enjoyable projects are when I can incorporate environmental topics into data science. I am passionate about sustainable practices and would love to find a career intersecting sustainability and data science.

In my free time, I enjoy dancing (mainly modern, contemporary, or just for fun), baking/cooking, playing with my 8-year-old German Shepherd, and watching reality shows/sitcoms. I have been dancing since I was 3 and danced competitively up until highschool. I am also trying to explore new recipes every week and find excitement in testing out new foods. 

Throughout the pandemic, I have been trying to step out of my comfort zone, and what better way than to tutor Intro to Data Science? I hope to be able to connect with each of you and I look forward to meeting you guys this quarter!
